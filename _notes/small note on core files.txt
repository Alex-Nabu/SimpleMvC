There are a few core files in the "controllers" directory and the "inc" directory.

Controllers directory:

The only core file here is the "router_controller" which admitidly is not a controller
but it felt right to put this here.

INC directory:

The core files here are "config.php" and "object_factory_inc.php" both files are core 
to the framwork and as uch SHOULD NOT BE DELETED. they may be modified for a custom expirence.

With the exception of these three files, the index file and the .htaccess file
all other files may be deleted but it is advisble to keep atlest some of them for reffrence.
